### ⚠️ Known Limitations (Alpha Release)

This is an **alpha release** - it's functional but not feature-complete. Expect rough edges:

- **No Undo/Redo**: Changes are permanent until we implement history management
- **Limited Effects**: No transitions, filters, or advanced effects yet
- **Basic Audio**: No mixing, volume envelopes, or audio effects
- **Export Options**: Limited format and quality presets
- **Stability**: Possible crashes with large projects or unusual file formats
- **Missing Features**: No keyboard shortcut customization, timeline markers, or plugin system

### 🎯 What's Next

We're focused on stability and core functionality for the v0.1.0 release:

- Undo/redo system
- More export formats and presets
- Video transitions and effects
- Audio mixing and volume controls
- Performance optimizations for large projects
- Bug fixes based on community feedback
